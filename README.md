## The Problem

India has **50+ million gig delivery workers** on platforms like Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit. They earn daily, live shift to shift, and have zero financial safety net.

Every day, things outside their control destroy their income:

| Disruption | Real Impact |
|---|---|
| Traffic Jam | 4 deliveries/hour to 1 delivery/hour — Rs.120/hour lost |
| Heavy Rain | Work stops entirely — Rs.300+ lost per event |
| Platform Algorithm Change | Orders drop 75% overnight — invisible income shock |
| Restaurant Delay | 30-min wait = 1 missed delivery — Rs.60 to Rs.80 lost |

There is currently no insurance product in India that protects gig workers from these uncontrollable, real-time income shocks.

---

## Our Solution

InsureO is an AI-driven parametric insurance platform that automatically detects income-impacting disruptions in real time, measures the actual earning loss, and triggers instant payouts without any manual claim filing. It also predicts disruptions before they happen so workers can avoid income loss proactively.

InsureO does not ask workers to prove their loss. The system detects it, verifies it, and pays it — automatically.

---

## The Core Idea: Earning Efficiency Model

Most systems just ask "Is there traffic?" — InsureO asks "Has the worker's earning ability actually dropped?"

```
efficiency = current_earnings / expected_earnings
```

Example — Bhubaneswar delivery partner:

| Metric | Normal | During Disruption |
|---|---|---|
| Orders/hour | 4 | 1 |
| Earnings/hour | Rs.160 | Rs.40 |
| Efficiency Score | 1.0 | 0.25 |

InsureO only triggers a payout when:
1. An external disruption is confirmed (traffic / weather / algorithm / delay)
2. AND the worker's efficiency drops below 0.5

This prevents fraud and makes sure payouts are genuinely warranted.

---

## Three Core Pillars

```
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  1. Income Protection        Parametric auto-payout        |
|     with Automation          when disruption confirmed     |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  2. Smart Earnings           AI predicts risks, suggests   |
|     Intelligence             better zones and routes       |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  3. Transparent and          Data-verified payouts with    |
|     Fraud-Resistant          multi-layer fraud detection   |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Disruptions Covered

### 1. Traffic Congestion

Heavy traffic reduces deliveries from 4/hour to 1/hour. Workers are active but inefficient — and that still causes income loss.

Detection logic:
```
delay_ratio = current_delivery_time / normal_delivery_time

IF delay_ratio > 1.5
AND traffic_level = HIGH
AND efficiency < 0.5
-> DISRUPTION TRIGGERED
```

Payout example:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Expected Earnings | Rs.160/hour |
| Actual Earnings | Rs.40/hour |
| Loss | Rs.120 |
| Coverage | 70% |
| Final Payout | Rs.84 |

Fraud check: GPS routes are cross-checked against live traffic data. If a worker is slow but traffic is normal, the claim is rejected.

---

### 2. Weather Disruption

Heavy rain, extreme heat, or storms reduce delivery activity or make roads unsafe.

Detection logic:
```
Fetch real-time weather data
IF rainfall > threshold (e.g. 100mm) OR weather alert active
-> Validate: worker in affected zone + was active
-> Calculate: loss = hourly_income x hours_lost
-> Apply payout policy (80% coverage)
-> Run fraud checks (GPS + activity)
-> Auto payout
```

Payout example:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Rainfall | 130mm |
| Work Hours Lost | 3 hrs |
| Estimated Loss | Rs.300 |
| Coverage | 80% |
| Final Payout | Rs.240 |

Predictive alert example:
```
Warning: Heavy rain expected at 7 PM (70% probability)
Predicted income drop: 25%
Suggested action: Work early hours or switch to Zone B
```

---

### 3. Platform Algorithm Disruption

Zomato, Swiggy, and Zepto update their order allocation algorithms silently. A worker's orders can drop 75% overnight with no explanation — this is invisible income shock.

Detection logic:
```python
# Z-score based anomaly detection
z_score = (current_orders - historical_mean) / std_dev

IF z_score < -2        # Statistically abnormal drop
AND no weather event
AND zone demand is normal
-> ALGORITHM DISRUPTION DETECTED
```

We also use Isolation Forest (scikit-learn) for more advanced behavioral anomaly detection across worker order history.

Real example:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Historical Avg Orders | 12/hour |
| Orders After Update | 3/hour |
| Drop Percentage | 75% |
| Threshold | 70% |
| Status | Flagged |

Our system goes beyond visible disruptions like weather by detecting invisible income shocks caused by platform algorithm changes using real-time behavioral anomaly detection.

---

### 4. Restaurant Preparation Delay

Riders sometimes wait 20-30 minutes at restaurants for orders to be prepared — time they could have spent completing another delivery.

Detection logic:
```
IF current_prep_time > 2 x avg_prep_time
AND rider GPS confirms location at restaurant
AND waiting_time > minimum threshold
-> DELAY DETECTED
```

Loss formula:
```
loss = (waiting_time / avg_delivery_time) x earning_per_delivery
payout = loss x coverage_factor (70-80%)
```

Payout example:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Average Prep Time | 10 min |
| Current Prep Time | 30 min |
| Waiting Time | 20 min |
| Estimated Loss | Rs.80 |
| Coverage | 75% |
| Final Payout | Rs.60 |

---

## Payout Model

InsureO uses dynamic parametric payouts, not fixed amounts.

```
Income Loss = Expected Earnings - Actual Earnings
Insurance Payout = Coverage % x Income Loss
```

Weekly premium structure (aligned to gig worker pay cycles):

| Zone Risk Level | Weekly Premium |
|---|---|
| Low Risk | Rs.20/week |
| Medium Risk | Rs.25/week |
| High Risk | Rs.30/week |

Dynamic coverage based on reliability score:

| Reliability Score | Coverage |
|---|---|
| 90-100 | 80% |
| 70-89 | 70% |
| Below 70 | 60% |

Workers with clean claim histories earn higher coverage. This discourages fraud and rewards consistent, honest participation.

---

## AI Risk Assessment

InsureO continuously scores every worker based on:
- Historical order patterns
- Live weather conditions
- Traffic congestion trends
- Restaurant preparation history
- Worker activity patterns

Sample output:

| Output | Value |
|---|---|
| Smart Earnings Score | 78 / 100 |
| Predicted Earnings Today | Rs.1,200 |
| Disruption Probability | 35% |

---

## Additional Features

### 1. Predictive Traffic Avoidance

InsureO predicts congestion before it hits using forecast APIs and historical patterns, so workers can reposition early instead of getting stuck.

Example alert: "Traffic likely to increase in 15 minutes in Area A. Consider moving now."

### 2. Smart Zone Switching

Based on real-time traffic and demand data, the app suggests better working zones.

Example: "Move to Zone B — 25% higher earning potential right now."

### 3. Loss Heatmap

A visual map of the city showing where workers are earning well and where they are losing money:
- Red zones — heavy income loss areas
- Yellow zones — moderate risk
- Green zones — high earning potential

### 4. Micro-Compensation Engine

Instead of waiting for hourly payouts, workers receive real-time credits every 15 minutes during confirmed disruptions.

### 5. Community Disruption Reporting

Workers can report accidents, restaurant glitches, and platform issues directly from the app. Multiple reports from the same zone help strengthen the AI detection system.

### 6. Voice Alerts — Hands-Free Assistance

Delivery workers are always on the move. Reading notifications while driving is unsafe. InsureO's voice alert system converts every critical event into a short, clear spoken message — delivered through the phone speaker or earphones.

Types of voice alerts:

| Type | Example |
|---|---|
| Risk Alert | "Heavy traffic ahead. Expect delay." |
| Opportunity Alert | "High demand in nearby zone. Move for better earnings." |
| Guidance Alert | "You have been waiting too long. Consider switching location." |
| System Alert | "Disruption detected. Compensation will be processed." |

How it works:
```
Traffic API / Weather API / Parametric Trigger
          ⇩
  Event Detection Engine (Backend)
          ⇩
  Alert Generation
          ⇩
  Priority and Filtering (max 1 alert per 2 minutes)
          ⇩
  WebSocket -> Mobile App
          ⇩
  Text-to-Speech Engine (Google TTS / Expo Speech)
          ⇩
  Audio output through speaker or earphones
```

Extra capabilities:
- Priority-based volume — critical alerts play louder than informational ones
- Context-aware — voice only activates when the worker is moving (GPS speed > 10 km/h)
- Multi-language support — English, Hindi, Odia, and other regional languages
- Alert throttling — no repeated alerts within 60 seconds
- Replay option — worker can replay the last alert with one tap

Voice alert data structure:
```json
{
  "message": "Heavy traffic ahead",
  "priority": "high",
  "type": "risk",
  "zone": "Zone A",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-17T10:00:00"
}
```

## Fraud Detection

Every payout goes through a multi-layer fraud check:

| Disruption Type | Fraud Signals Monitored |
|---|---|
| Traffic | GPS route + speed + nearby worker speeds |
| Weather | Weather API + city alerts + zone activity |
| Algorithm | Cross-worker order distribution + login patterns |
| Restaurant Delay | Restaurant timestamps + multi-worker corroboration |

If only one worker shows an anomaly while all nearby workers are performing normally, the claim is flagged and held for review.
